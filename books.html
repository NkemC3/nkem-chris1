    <h1>I. What it's All About</h1>

    <p>Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspaper and magazines?</p>

    <p>More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by the makers of calendars, postcards, for advertisement, and for illustrating books, stories and articles? </p>

   <blockquote> 
    <p>This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: 
        "How can i make my camera-work profitable ?"</p>

  <p> The camerist does not have to get in air-ship and fly to Africa in order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:  </p> 

  <blockquote> 
    <p> <q>The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the attention of the world now and then. <em> This is a delusion. The real triumph is that of the photographer who utilizes the material ready at hand in its own district, be it large or small.</q> </em>
  </p>
